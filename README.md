# Algorithms and Data Structures in Go

Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures repository, where we explore the fundamentals of computer science through the lens of Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. This project is designed by a developer and student deeply interested in understanding and applying algorithms and data structures efficiently.
